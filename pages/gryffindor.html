      <h1>HOUSE OF GRYFFINDOR</h1>
      <p>House Lead - Mishelle</p>
      <p>House Prefect - Jake</p>
      <h3>Description</h3>
      <h4>Gryffindor house is where you would find the pluckiest and most daring students (there’s a reason the house symbol is the brave lion). The house colours are scarlet and gold, the common room lies up in Gryffindor Tower and the Head of House is Professor Minerva McGonagall.

         If the Sorting Hat placed you here, you would have demonstrated qualities like courage, bravery and determination. Some of the wizarding world’s best and brightest belonged to this house – Harry Potter and Albus Dumbledore are just a couple that spring to mind!
         
         If you are lucky enough to end up in Gryffindor, we imagine you’re the type of person who likes to stand up for the little guy, challenges authority, has a tendency to act first and think later, is known as a class clown and takes board games very seriously.</h4>
