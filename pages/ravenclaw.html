      <h1>HOUSE OF RAVENCLAW</h1>
      <p>House Lead - Shazelle</p>
      <h3>Description</h3>
      <h4>If you are looking for the brainiest students – you would find them in Ravenclaw (with a couple of notable exceptions like Hermione Granger). The Ravenclaw colours are blue and bronze, the emblem is an eagle, the Head of House is Professor Filius Flitwick and the common room sits at the top of Ravenclaw Tower behind an enchanted knocker.

         The Sorting Hat would only put you in this house if you demonstrated excellent wisdom, wit and a skill for learning. Ravenclaws are often known for being quite eccentric and most of the great wizarding inventors and innovators have come from this house.
         
         We can imagine that you would get to sit up in Ravenclaw Tower, while surveying the excellent views, if you’re the type of person who analyses everything, is an overachiever, can be described as away with the fairies, is not afraid to be an individual and has a head stuffed full of interesting facts.</h4>
